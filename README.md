# Assignment 4 - Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python

This repository includes scripts that demonstrate file handling and exception management in Python.

## Task 1: Read File with Error Handling
- Tries to read a file named `sample.txt`.
- Prints its contents line by line.
- If the file doesn't exist, it shows a custom error message.

**File:** `read_file_with_error_handling.py`

## Task 2: Write and Append to a File
- Takes user input and writes it to `output.txt`.
- Prompts for additional input and appends it.
- Finally reads and displays the full content of the file.

**File:** `write_append_file.py`

Tested on Python 3. If `sample.txt` does not exist, Task 1 will show an error message.
